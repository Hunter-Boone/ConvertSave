# ConvertSave

## Project Description
This will be a native application using Tauri. Frontend will be React/Tailwind/shadcn. The app will be a local file conversion utility that will take one file and convert it into a number of other file types. We will be using ffmpeg, pandoc, libreoffice, imagemagick and more to do the conversions. Whatever tools we can use we should use. The app will be cross-platform for Windows, Mac, and Linux. We want the look of it to be similar to how Gumroad has its UI with chunky colorful buttons with muted tones. There will be a very simple UI where the user can just drop a file into it or the user can click on the drop zone and it opens a file explorer. Then there's an option for whatever file types we can convert to. We should allow for literally any file type that our tools can convert

    1.3. Date: October 26, 2023
    1.4. Author: [Your Name/Team Name]
    1.5. Purpose: This document outlines the product requirements for ConvertSave, a native, cross-platform file conversion utility. It details the product's goals, features, functional and non-functional requirements, and design specifications.

2.  Product Overview
    ConvertSave is designed to be a comprehensive local file conversion utility. It will operate as a native desktop application, leveraging the Tauri framework for cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux). The application's core functionality is to take a single input file and convert it into various other file types, utilizing a suite of powerful, pre-bundled command-line tools such as FFmpeg, Pandoc, LibreOffice, and ImageMagick. The user interface will be simple, intuitive, and visually distinct, aiming for an aesthetic similar to Gumroad's UI with chunky, colorful buttons and muted tones. The primary goal is to provide a robust, easy-to-use tool for any user requiring local file conversions, without relying on cloud services.

3.  Goals & Objectives
    3.1. Primary Goal: To provide a highly versatile, local file conversion utility capable of converting "literally any file type that our tools can convert" using bundled third-party command-line utilities.
    3.2. Secondary Objectives:
        *   Deliver a native, cross-platform application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
        *   Ensure a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing user interface.
        *   Allow users granular control over conversion settings through advanced options.
        *   Bundle all necessary conversion tools within the application package for offline functionality and ease of use.
        *   Ensure the application "works properly" across various hardware configurations.
4.  Target Audience & Use Cases
    4.1. Target Audience: Any user looking to convert files locally, from casual users to those requiring specific, advanced conversion options. Marketing will be conducted through internal YouTube channels.
    4.2. Use Cases:
        *   **Basic File Conversion**: A user has a `.mov` file and needs to convert it to `.mp4` for sharing. They drag and drop the `.mov` file into ConvertSave, select `.mp4` from the list of output options, and click "Convert".
        *   **Specific Document Conversion**: A student needs to convert a `.docx` file into a `.pdf` or `.epub`. They open ConvertSave, click the drop zone to open a file explorer, select the `.docx` file, choose the desired output format, and initiate conversion.
        *   **Advanced Image Conversion**: A designer wants to convert a `.png` to a `.jpg` with specific quality settings or apply a resize operation not available in basic options. They use the advanced options section to input specific ImageMagick flags.
        *   **Batch Conversion (Future Consideration/Implicit)**: While not explicitly requested, the architecture should ideally allow for future expansion into simple batch processing, even if not implemented initially. The current scope is for single file conversion.
        *   **Custom Output Location**: A user wants to save their converted file directly to a specific project folder instead of the default output directory. They select a custom destination folder before conversion.
